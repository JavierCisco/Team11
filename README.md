# How to Run Project:
#FIRST please Make sure you have Python and pygame (therefore inferring pip as well) downloaded. I am assuming that you already have the #Psycopg2 module installed on your virtual machine for the database. Because that is what the example on Mr. Strother's Github was using. I # am saying this because my virutal machine did not have it installed, and I had to. So I hope y'all have it already. 

- Download all files in our main branch.
